									My initial brainstorm for this site was prompted by a game I made for a web
									development class at UC Davis, as well as my passion for film photography as a hobby
									and artistic medium.
									<br />
									<br />
									Around the office building where I worked at the time, there existed a band of stray
									cats, and one day I took a series of photos of them on my Pentax K1000. I chose to
									create a game in which the user would click through a series of my photos with the
									intention of finding each cat.
									<br />
									<br />
									The user was able to click on various points of interests to zoom in/out and move
									around the office building during their search. The game was inspired by a desire to
									use/share my film photos through web dev projects, so I chose to dive into that
									desire and make an entire website dedicated to my hobby.
									<br />

									Before the coding process, I created several prototypes in Adobe XD to work from. I
									made these with several points of emphasis in mind:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Photography should be easily accessible and pleasant to view with as much user
										control as possible
									</li>
									<li>
										Design should be as minimal, readable, and accessible as possible while still
										maintaining a tasteful and purposeful feeling
									</li>
									<li>
										Follow brutalist web design aesthetics while incorporating calm, earthy, and
										less stark color schemes
									</li>
									<li>Emphasize images</li>
									<li>Utilize captions and accompanying text for my images sparingly</li>
									<li>Include cat game as bonus area</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									I designed a homepage displaying circles for “featured collections” &#8211; which
									could then be clicked to go to the corresponding photoshoot. It was my hope that
									this would enable immediate user interest and interaction.
									<br />
									<br />
									I designed the individual “collection pages” largely around images &#8211; with a
									scrollable gallery displaying large images. To fulfill my desire of maximum user
									control/interaction, I included a “control center” showing key controls for the user
									to apply filters to the images in the gallery. Also included was a minimal
									navigation bar and the title of the photoshoot. One feature not included in my
									wireframes that would be added in my first working prototype is a "down arrow" below
									the image slideshow that would display a menu with info about the shoot.
									<br />
									<br />
									I also designed an archive page, where the user could view every single one of my
									photos in a large gallery. Finally, I designed the game page in a minimal fashion,
									with the game itself at the center of the page and constantly visible
									controls/instructions.

									After building a working draft of my site faithful to the design of my protoypes, I
									began my user testing process, in which I allowed three of my peers to interact with
									my site with no direction or context. After this, I would ask for their favorite
									parts of the site, as well as things they found unclear / suggestions for
									improvements. I&#8217;ve summarized the result of each user test here
									<em>
										[please note the screenshot of the working prototype for reference on their
										critiques]
									</em>
									:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<em>Alessandra:</em>
										During Alessandra's testing, the action of clicking the down arrow to display
										"info" was not immediately apparent, and so she completely ignored it until
										afterwards when I told her about it. Instead, she thought that it was saying to
										scroll down. Also, Alessandra's first instinct was to scroll horizontally
										instead of vertically to navigate the photo slideshow. I will take all this
										advice into account and add more scrolling functionality + redesign the down
										arrow.
									</li>
									<li>
										<em>Adam:</em>
										Adam was also working on a photography site that displayed our photos in
										slideshows, so we exchanged some helpful and relevant ideas (most notably, a way
										to enable both vertical and horizontal scrolling on a horizontal slideshow).
										Adam thought that the "collections" page seemed redundant when compared to the
										home page, since they serve incredibly similar purposes. Also, he thought that
										the arrow for info was unclear, and should perhaps be changed to a button saying
										"info" or something along those lines.
									</li>
									<li>
										<em>Guan:</em>
										Guan really enjoyed the filter controls for the images, but he suggested that
										the phrasing for the instructions could be clearer, like "press 'g' for
										grayscale" instead of "'g' for grayscale." He also echoed the sentiment that the
										down arrow for info was vague, and should be changed into something more clear
										that better communicated its purpose. This issue was echoed throughout all my
										user tests, so I will be sure to address it in my final product.
									</li>

									The final design of my website was faithful to my initial design, with several
									accessibility changes based off user tests, and personal brainstorming.
									<br />
									<br />
									I maintained my homepage design and centered the page around featured circle links
									and added a hue-rotate filter on hover to hint towards the filter interactions
									afforded to the user. I changed the “ALL” link from my wireframes to a “random”
									link, which will take the user to a random photoshoot page. Not only is this a fun
									option for the indecisive viewer, but it also removes the redundancy given the
									“collections” link in the navigation menu.
									<br />
									<br />
									In line with a common critique during user testing, I replaced the “down arrow”
									leading to the info section with a large, interactive “info” button, complete with
									hover animations and color change. This makes its purpose clear, fun, and
									unambiguous. I chose to retain my “controls” menu from the prototype, as I believe
									the wording makes for a fun feeling of discovering a hidden feature in key controls
									to interact with the photos as the user. Perhaps the biggest addition to the user
									page was diverse scrolling functionality, allowing the user to scroll through the
									image gallery using both horizontal and vertical scrolling on their trackpad.
									Everybody that had tested my website before this point was compelled to scroll in a
									different direction, so this solved that conundrum and made a “wrong choice”
									impossible.
									<br />
									<br />
									A large addition to the site is the “collections” page &#8211; with a menu of all my
									photoshoots to date that can be scrolled through/cycled using arrow buttons. Next to
									the menu exists an empty circle, which will be filled in with a preview of each
									photoshoot when hovering over the corresponding title.

									Much of my initial design inspiration came while browsing through photography
									portfolio websites that I found on
									<a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards.com</a>
									. In particular, I enjoyed
									<a href="https://www.icelandicexplorer.com/projects">Icelandic Explorer</a>
									, for Gunnar Freyr’s portfolio, and
									<a href="https://slowness.com/encyclopedia-of-the-farm/">Slowness</a>
									-- about “La Granja” in Ibiza.
									<br />
									<br />
									For “
									<em>Icelandic Explorer</em>
									”, I greatly admired the strong balance between bold typography and photographs
									&#8211; both received large emphasis but did not detract from the other. I also
									enjoyed the creative animations/transitions applied to images upon hover/click,
									which was fun and interactive from my standpoint as a user. While the site had a
									photo gallery similar to mine, the only navigation option was to “click and drag”
									through it, which quickly became cumbersome and unintuitive.
									<br />
									<br />
									For “
									<em>Slowness</em>
									”, I enjoyed the image interaction process the most &#8211; after selecting an image
									the flash and exposure on the image would change. This made my experience in viewing
									the photos active and interesting, and compelled me to stay and mess around with the
									site longer than I would have had I only had the option to view the photos and not
									interact with them.

									<em>From my first design brief:</em>
									<br />
									<br />
									My design will be minimal, readable, and accessible while still maintaining a
									tasteful and purposeful feeling. I will follow brutalist web design aesthetics while
									incorporating calm, earthy, and less stark color schemes. I hope to emphasize the
									images on my website and have a sans-serif accompanying font that will pop out
									without overtaking the images.
									<br />
									<br />
									I&#8217;d like to utilize captions and accompanying text for my images very
									sparingly. I&#8217;d prefer that the viewer interpret the pictures for themselves
									without trying to relate it back to certain context that I&#8217;ve given them.
									<br />
									<br />
									It is likely that the images in each gallery will be displayed largely and evenly,
									with small typography stating basic info like date, concept/collection name,
									location, camera, film type etc.
									<br />
									<br />
									The biggest feature that I think will make my project unique in comparison to other
									galleries is that the user will be able to apply filters to the images they are
									viewing as they please, giving the page a fun and interactive nature as opposed to a
									passive viewing one.

									The first iterations of my site came through preliminary designs made in Adobe XD,
									and a working draft of my site based off these designs to be used in user testing.
									<br />
									<br />
									I designed a homepage displaying circles for “featured collections” &#8211; which
									could then be clicked to go to the corresponding photoshoot. It was my hope that
									this would enable immediate user interest and interaction.
									<br />
									<br />
									I designed the individual “collection pages” largely around
									<b>images</b>
									#8211; with a scrollable gallery displaying large views of my photography. To
									fulfill my desire of maximum user control/interaction, I included a “control center”
									showing key controls for the user to apply filters to the images in the gallery.
									Also included was a minimal navigation bar and the title of the photoshoot. In my
									working prototype, I included a "down arrow" below the image slideshow that would
									display a menu with info about the shoot. The down arrow would be changed to an
									"info button" to better clarify its purpose and address concerns from user testing.
									<br />
									<br />
									I also designed an archive page, where the user could view every single one of my
									photos in a large gallery. Finally, I designed the "game" page in a minimal fashion,
									with the game itself at the center of the page and constantly visible
									controls/instructions.

									The major final changes for the site came in the info button + dropdown, and a new
									"collections" page. I styled the dropdown functionality around an interactive "info"
									button, that brings up a section on info about the shoot and a collage giving an
									overall representation of the shoot. Upon click, the button changes to an "x" which
									closes the section.
									<br />
									<br />
									The "collections" page features a menu of all my photoshoots to date [including
									those not present in the featured shoots on the homepage] that can be scrolled
									through/cycled using arrow buttons. Next to the menu exists an empty circle, which
									will be filled in with a preview of each photoshoot when hovering over the
									corresponding title.
									<br />
									<br />
									I chose a light tan color [#d8d3cd] to convey a warm, welcome feeling without
									clashing with my photos. I chose "General Sans Light" for my type, as it is a bold,
									clean sans-serif font that accentuates the web design without overtaking the images

									I created this website to share and collect my film photography, and explore the
									concept of “interactive art” and
									<em>active viewing experiences</em>
									.
									<br />
									<br />
									In my experience viewing art on the computer, the process has seemed passive in a
									way that viewing art in person does not. At a museum, the viewer is enabled to walk
									around the piece, viewing it from different angles and lighting &#8211; this creates
									an active link between the viewer and the art. On the computer, this action is taken
									away &#8211; a .png or a .jpg is flat and static. Through this website, I enabled
									the viewer to take action while they view my photos, experimenting with different
									filters and colors, effectively viewing it at different angles and lighting as one
									could at a museum.
									<br />
									<br />
									The presence of fun and creative user interaction options is something that has
									interested me greatly during my web development & design journey, and it has given
									me an interest in the potential of viewing art and photography on a website [and
									websites as an artistic medium of their own].
