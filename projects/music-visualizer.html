									This is my final project for DES 111 at UC Davis, a creative coding class for
									designers using
									<a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a>
									[a graphical library and IDE using the Java language]. The assignment was open ended
									and I was granted complete creative and conceptual control.
									<br />
									<br />
									My initial brainstorm for this project was inspired by early 2000s iTunes music
									visualizers. I remember loving to watch the animations on my family computer while I
									listened to music as a child -- but I always felt frustrated that the visualizers
									were not connected to the beat of the music.
									<br />
									<br />
									For my project, I resolved to make a customizable music visualizer of my own that
									would follow the bpm of the song at hand.

									Before the coding process, I sketched several UI concepts alongside some notes on
									their accompanying UX features. From the beginning, I felt strongly that the user
									must have customization control over the visualizer, and the visualizer animation
									should be directly linked to the bpm of the song, effectively shifting and moving
									with it.
									<br />
									<br />
									I decided that the visualizer would consist of overlapping transparent shapes with
									varying stroke colors, attached to different waveforms from the chosen song file.
									<br />
									<br />
									The user would have the option to customize these shapes, and choose either
									rectangles or ellipses. The user would also be able to choose the stroke color, from
									various static colors or constantly shifting random colors for a rainbow strobelight
									effect.

									The first version of the project was meant to develop the visualizer animation and
									functionality, with a rough UI meant to brainstorm color schemes and develop a
									feeling to work from.
									<br />
									<br />
									I began by stacking several ellipses and tying their dimensions to the left and
									right channels of the currently playing stereo audio track using the
									<a href="https://code.compartmental.net/minim/">minim</a>
									library. Each circle relied in a different manner on the audio channels, creating a
									fluctuating, versatile, geometric effect. I also added a version of this using
									rectangles instead of ellipses. For the UI, I decided on a black background, to
									match early iTunes visualizers.
									<br />
									<br />
									In the next version of my project, I added customization options. I added
									functionality to switch between “ellipse” and “rectangle” options, and afforded the
									user basic color (blue, red, yellow) + a rainbow option that would change to a
									random color on each beat of the song. I also experimented with “fill” and “no-fill”
									options for the shapes used in the visualizer. The type included in the rough
									version was meant for my own personal reference during testing and would later be
									implemented into the final UI.

									controls and control to return to the homepage. Also included on the homepage are
									several color-scheme options for the UI, with a default “dark mode,” “light mode,”

									<br />
									<br />
									At the top of each “now playing” page exists a bar showing progress through the

									Since I would be using Processing for this project, I found further inspiration in
									<em>Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists</em>
									by Casey Reas. I was inspired by creative coding projects based around audio,
									including
									<a href="http://www.flong.com/archive/projects/messa/index.html">Messa di Voce</a>
									by Golan Levin and
									<a href="https://youtu.be/Q_BhXEQF8Kk">Multimedia Beethoven: The Ninth Symphony</a>

									From the beginning, I was resolved to design my program as a “music player” &#8211;
									emphasizing song metadata with a centered music player. This is directly inspired by
									old iTunes visualizers, as well as new ones &#8211; in modern Apple Music
									“mini-players” the album art takes up 80% of the display, with the song name, album
									name, artist, and a progress bar taking the rest. I would include all of these
									things in my UI, with my visualizer essentially replacing the spot of the album art.
									<br />
									<br />
									I hoped to communicate a vintage feeling similar to old CD-ROM programs with my
									default UI color scheme, using a black background and blue text.

									The first iteration of the project was meant to develop the visualizer animation and
									functionality, with a rough UI meant to brainstorm color schemes and type + develop
									a feeling to work from.
									<br />
									<br />
									I developed a version of the visualizer using ellipses, as well as a version using
									rectangles. Inline with my initial objectives, I decided on a black background with
									blue type.
									<br />
									<br />
									The color scheme of my project stayed largely the same through different variations,
									and the biggest changes lied in the user flow and UI layout.
									<br />
									<br />
									In the second iteration of my project, I added customization options. I added
									functionality to switch between “ellipse” and “rectangle” options, and afforded the
									user basic color (blue, red, yellow) + a rainbow option that would change to a
									random color on each beat of the song. I also experimented with “fill” and “no-fill”

									version was meant for my own personal reference during testing and would later be

									This app was made through the desire to create a music visualizer that followed the
									beat of the music, inspired by a childhood frustration that early iTunes music
									visualizers were randomly generated with no relation to the song at hand.
									<br />
									<br />
									The music player and visualizer was written in Processing using the Minim library.
									The app generates rectangular or ellipse patterns based on the waveform + bpm of the
									chosen song. The user can customize the stroke color and desired shape of the
									visualizer pattern. The user has the option to cycle between 5 different songs.
									<br />
									<br />
									USER CONTROLS: ** also outlined in app **
									<br />
									<br />
									1-5 keys cycle between 5 different song options (each key corresponds to a different
									song)
									<br />
									<br />
									a-e keys control play functionality for each song -- a will play "1", b will play
									"2" etc.
									<br />
									<br />
									"u" key selects ellipse visualizer -- "v" key selects rectangular visualizer
									<br />
									<br />
									w-z keys cycle through various stroke color options
									<br />
									<br />
									SPACE key will stop playback.
