									<em>From my first design brief:</em>
									<br />
									<br />
									My website design will be minimal and brutalist, with the intention of keeping the
									emphasis on user interaction with art. My background colors will be white, black, or
									brown, and my type will be green, red, black, or white. Navigation will be simple
									and straightforward, and art will be centered and own most of the viewport.
								</p>
								<p>
									Since images are the driving user experience in this site, I wanted the aesthetics
									of the site to blend seamlessly into background and not change the user's
									perceptions of each image -- the user experience IS the aesthetic.

									My first working prototypes of the website used blue Monospaced text against a black
									background, inline with my "early internet" and brutalist inspirations. I hoped to
									give the feeling of a terminal / console interface. However, as I showed the design
									to my peers, I realized the color pallette was too harsh, and compromised
									readability.
									<br />
									I decided to keep the minimal page layout and Monospaced font, and change the colors
									to an easily readable pallette with dark text against a light background.

									I created this site as a way to inspire a shift away from academic conceptions of
									art for the user. I've often had friends tell me that they feel as if they can't
									enjoy a museum because they are not formally educated in art history -- this is a
									shame, as the enjoyment of art ultimately lies in personal subjectivity.
									<br />
									<br />
									By interacting with art pieces without context or labels, the user is able to simply
									enjoy the images at face value. By doing this, I hoped the user would reflect upon
									their personal taste and identify places of emotional resonance [specifically in the
									emotion part of the quiz]. At the end of the experience, I provided the user with
									subjective results [suggestions towards why the user felt how they did about their
									chosen art, and a shifting colorful 'aura'] and objective results [artists, titles,
									dates, and subject matter]. Ultimately, I hoped this would encourage the user to
									feel less intimidated about forming opinions and emotions on art, and that all
									thought on art is equally valuable, academic or not.
